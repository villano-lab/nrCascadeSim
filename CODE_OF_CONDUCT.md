The following code of conduct must be followed in all places associated with this repository itself. This includes issues, pull requests, and all files contained within the repository. The code of conduct applies to all contributors and community members.

In addition to following GitHub's terms of service and any laws applicable to you, please:

    Do your best to properly attribute any copied, vendored, or otherwise "borrowed" code. In particular, make sure to provide LICENSE files when necessary.
    Be courteous to other contributors/community members.
    Do not make major changes to LICENSE or CONTRIBUTING.md
        Clarifications and spelling/grammar fixes are fine; modifying the rules is not.
    Avoid vulgar or offensive language.
    Stay on-topic; all discussion, including issues and pull requests, must relate to this repository in some way, and should not focus on something other than the code and its modification.
    No malicious code/malware of any kind, including but not limited to ransomware, adware, bloatware, and spyware.

Failure to comply with this code of conduct could result in having your access to the community restricted, such as having offending posts removed or being barred from further submissions.

You can report code of conduct violations to a maintainer (@gerudo7 or @villaa) or the @villano-lab group via direct message or email. If you see a violation of GitHub's ToS or of a local or federal law, please report it to the appropriate authorities first. Thanks!
