3. The libraries of *nrCascadeSim*
========================================

The functionality of the executables of *nrCascadeSim* such as `realizeCascades` is constructed
from a set of library functions whose code is stored in the `libncap.so` file and whose prototypes
are stored in several header files. Below we list the different header files with the internal
functions, data structures, and their uses.
